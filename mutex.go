//solve race conditions using mutexes and channels.
//When a program runs concurrently, the parts of code which modify shared resources should not be accessed by multiple Goroutines at the same time.
//This section of code that modifies shared resources is called critical section.
//This is solved by mutex
//A Mutex is used to provide a locking mechanism to ensure that only one Goroutine is running the critical section of code at any point in time
//to prevent race conditions from happening.

//Mutex is available in the sync package. There are two methods defined on Mutex namely Lock and Unlock.
//Any code that is present between a call to Lock and Unlock will be executed by only one Goroutine
